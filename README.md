"Art for Impact". Node.js Server for Managing Donated Artwork in Support of a Non-Profit

Description:
This is a Node.js, Express, and MongoDB server application to facilitate the management of donated artworks by artists in support of a non-profit organization. The application allows artists to register and upload details about their donated artworks, including images, descriptions, and estimated values. Non-profit administrators can then review and approve donated artworks for inclusion in online fundraising events. The server provides endpoints for artists to submit artwork information, administrators to review and manage artwork submissions, and users to browse and make donations in exchange for a piece of artwork they like. The application emphasizes transparency, accountability, and efficiency in handling donated artworks to maximize their impact on supporting the non-profit's mission.
